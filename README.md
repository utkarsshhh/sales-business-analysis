# sales-business-analysis

### This code file here performs business analysis on the sales records for 50 weeks


## Introduction

I have built this project based on the data provided by [Stratascratch](https://www.stratascratch.com) as part of a Data project. It provides the sales data for 50 weeks and this code analyzes the data to answer the following business questions:

1. When has been there a sudden change in the daily
2. Is the sudden change in the daily sales is due to change in the gender ratio of the consumers ?
3. How are the sales distributed over the four dayparts of a day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) ?


## Usage

### Installation
The code is present in a Jupyter Notebook __Business_Analysis.ipynb__ and requires Python 3.9 to run it. The Jupyter Notebook can be run in the browser or can be installed from [here](https://jupyter.org)

### Data
The data is present in the __datasets__ folder in the root directory. It consists of sales records for 50 weeks present in 50 csv files.

### Libraries
The following libraries have been used in the code:
1. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
2. [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
3. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)


## Result

The data has been wrangled according to the use cases of the business. The plots using pandas and matplotlib have been used to visualise the analysis of the data and provide answers relevant to the business.
